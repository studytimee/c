What are Pointers?

Different from other normal variables which can store values, pointers are special variables that can hold the address of a variable. Since they store memory address of a variable, the pointers are very commonly said to “point to variables”. Lets try to understand the concept.


As shown in the above diagram:

A normal variable ‘var’ has a memory address of 1001 and holds a value 50.
A pointer variable has its own address 2047 but stores 1001, which is the address of the variable ‘var’
